## Deployment Strategy

### 1. Static Hosting
The application is designed for static hosting platforms:
- **Recommended**: Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages
- **Requirements**: Any web server capable of serving static files
- **No Build Process**: Ready to deploy as-is

### 2. Performance Considerations

- **Reduced Motion**: Respects user's motion preferences
- **Optimized Assets**: External CDN resources for caching
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Core functionality works without external libraries

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Vanilla JavaScript Over Frameworks
**Problem**: Need for a lightweight, fast-loading portfolio site
**Solution**: Pure JavaScript with class-based architecture
**Rationale**: Eliminates build steps, reduces bundle size, improves loading speed
**Trade-offs**: More manual DOM manipulation but better performance

### 2. CSS Custom Properties for Theming
**Problem**: Dynamic theme switching without JavaScript style manipulation
**Solution**: CSS custom properties with data attributes
**Rationale**: Leverages browser's native CSS engine for smooth transitions
**Benefits**: Better performance, easier maintenance, accessibility friendly

### 3. Intersection Observer for Animations
**Problem**: Efficient scroll-triggered animations
**Solution**: Modern Intersection Observer API instead of scroll events
**Rationale**: Better performance, automatic cleanup, respects motion preferences
**Alternatives**: Traditional scroll events (more performance overhead)

### 4. JSON-based Internationalization
**Problem**: Multi-language content management
**Solution**: JSON files with fetch-based loading
**Rationale**: Easy content updates, scalable to more languages
**Trade-offs**: Async loading required but enables better content management
